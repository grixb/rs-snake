# RS-SNAKE

This project relies on an unreasonably generic solution for fun.
Its purpose is only practice. Anyway, it's perfect for boredom buster. :)

## Build

Before, You have to [install](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) `rust` and `cargo`, then

```bash
cargo build; cargo run
```

Have fun and feel free to send me any brain drain PR!
